This is a JS tinkering file, where we've done all the basic learning for running things in the client-side.

It implements a random text changer for some of the content, a function that takes a sample text and feeds it segment by segment into a text input for testing, which then is polled, and the text has its vowels removed, and the number of letters counted.

The counting function is fed into a bar chart display, which is especially fun.

There's some button experiments, including a 'text span id as link' idea, where a button is labeled with an id that represents a key for what to do when it's clicked, fetched by an event handler.

It's repo'd mainly because we keep copying parts out to use elsewhere (like the text button ide thing- it underwrites the ZIM viewer)
